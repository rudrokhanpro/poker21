## Rules

Poker 21 is a card game that consists of getting as close as possible to a score of 21 which is obtained by adding up the scores of each card that is drawn. The player wins if he reaches 21, or if he decides to stop and the next card card is higher than 21. Each card is worth its point value, except for the Ace which is worth 0 points, and the King, Queen and Jack which are worth 10 points each.
