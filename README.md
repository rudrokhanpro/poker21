## Rules

Poker 21 is a card game that consists of getting as close as possible to a score of 21 which is obtained by adding up the scores of each card that is drawn. The player wins if he reaches 21, or if he decides to stop and the next card card is higher than 21. Each card is worth its point value, except for the Ace which is worth 0 points, and the King, Queen and Jack which are worth 10 points each.

- The deck contains 52 cards.
- Two cards are drawn when the game starts.
- You can stand : you draw a card and the next card card is higher than 21, you win.
- You can draw one or more cards at once. Be aware that the point value are computed at once on each draw.
- You can cancel a draw before the computation.
- You cannot start a new game until you win or lose.
- You cannot draw a card if the deck is empty.
- You cannot restart a game if you haven't draw a card after the beginning.
